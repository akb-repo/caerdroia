> _"Among the roots of the trees you awaken,_
> _Birds leer rapturously upon your disoriented visage,_
> _The redstart solemnizes your parturition with angelic aria,_
> _You recall the year was at its twilight, yet now birthed anew, blossoming with verdant,_
> _All of your consciousness, connected with the weald like hyphae,_
> _Abstracting your past life beyond all fragile recall,_
> _This caerdroia is sacred, you know that you are home now. The trees willed it."_

### Designed with Purpose
At the heart of Caerdroia lies immense attention to detail, and thoughtful design. Designed with two-toned anodization in mind, the details of the design come to life and expose every decision made on the path taken.

### Integrated USB Hub
Clean up that maze of cables on your desk with the built-in USB hub. Featuring two ports of USB passthrough goodness.

### TKL Roots, Reimagined
Caerdroia stays true to the roots of a classic TKL with its F12 forced WKL layout and top mounted structure- but it's not afraid to branch out.

The plate kitted in by default is a 4.5mm thick frosted PC CNC plate. Not for the faint of heart, this plate adds a slight layer of rigidity to the typing feel while not deadening the sound. This allows your build choices to truly shine.
